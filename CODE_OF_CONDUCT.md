* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

* Pursuing mathematical elegance and philosophical rigor

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Harassment of any kind
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
