# Contributing to Unified ARF System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Unified Autonomous Research Framework!

## 🎯 Philosophy

When contributing, please keep in mind our core philosophical principles:
- **Inevitability**: Features should feel necessary, not arbitrary
- **Elegance**: Solutions should be beautiful and simple
- **Parsimony**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Explanatory Power**: Contributions should unify or clarify

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes following the guidelines below
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Document all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### Adding New Agents
When adding a new agent:
1. Define its philosophical role clearly
2. Ensure it complements existing agents
3. Document its evaluation criteria
4. Add appropriate tests

### Adding Validation Sources
New data sources should:
1. Be freely accessible or have clear licensing
2. Include proper caching mechanisms
3. Have error handling for network issues
4. Document the data format

### Philosophy Modifications
Changes to the evaluation criteria require:
1. Clear justification
2. Examples of improved outcomes
3. Discussion in an issue before implementation

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests before submitting:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

For new features, add tests in `tests/test_your_feature.py`

## 📖 Documentation

- Update README.md if adding major features
- Document new configuration options
- Include docstrings for all new functions
- Add examples for complex features

## 🐛 Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:
1. System configuration (OS, Python version)
2. Relevant parts of config.yaml
3. Error messages and logs
4. Steps to reproduce

## 💡 Feature Requests

Feature requests should:
1. Align with the philosophical core
2. Include use cases
3. Consider impact on existing functionality
4. Be discussed in issues first

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Update CHANGELOG.md
5. Request review from maintainers
